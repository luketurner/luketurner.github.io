    <p>
      I like building websites, apps, and software tools. It's my job, but I also do this stuff for fun!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have an idea but don't know how to bring it into reality, I'll collaborate with you on it <strong>for free</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more general information about me and links to some of my past projects, see:

    <h2>Will Dos</h2>

    <p>
      I will collaborate with <strong>individuals</strong>, <strong>groups</strong>, <strong>communities</strong>, and in some cases <strong>non-profits</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ways I can contribute:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Consultations (Phone/Zoom/In Person): Discussing feasibility, requirements, maintenance, publishing costs, tips and tricks, etc.</li>
      <li>Writing and deploying the project: For most projects, I can take them from zero to being fully complete and published on the Internet for people to use.</li>
      <li>Short-term maintenance and tech support: I can help fix issues and assist users, however support will not continue indefinitely.</li>
      <li>Mentoring and pair programming: If you are learning software engineering yourself, I'm happy to provide guidance, mentorship, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you're unsure, just send me an email. The worst that could happen is I say no. Most likely, even if a project isn't suitable for me, I can at least consult
      with you about next steps to get your idea realized.
    </p>

    <h2>Will Not Dos</h2>

    <p>
      I <strong>will not</strong> collaborate on any projects that:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Are used by a for-profit entity, or intend to be profitable in the future.</li>
      <li>Cause harm or otherwise violate my ethics.</li>
      <li>Have monetization, e.g. advertisements, subscriptions, or in-app purchases.</li>
      <li>Are private, secret, or proprietary.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Also, I will not provide full-time availability or long-term support.
      Of course, I will make a best-effort attempt to make the collaboration a success, but no guarantees are offered.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a regular day job, these collaborations are just for fun.
    </p>

    <h2>Licensing and Copyright</h2>
    <p>
      Unless we decide otherwise, <strong>I will own the copyright</strong> for all collaborations as the primary code author.
    </p>
    <p>
      The source code for our collaborations will be released under the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit">MIT License</a>
      and published in my <a href="https://github.com/luketurner">Github</a> profile. Note that private information or user data will not be published.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the same approach I take for all my hobby projects. It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source model</a>,
      and it allows others to contribute to, copy, and use the project for their own needs. Open source software is the backbone of the Internet, and by
      making our collaboration open source as well, we give back to the software engineering community as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MIT License means that if you want to hand off the project to someone else in the future, you can safely do so. They can freely use
      and modify the project, and they can own the copyright for those modifications.
    </p>
