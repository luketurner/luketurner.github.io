		<p>Rating:&nbsp;★★★★☆</p>
<p><em>Mushi-shi</em> is a rare beast: a truly episodic anime series. Each episode is completely self-contained, and only Ginko, the protagonist, appears in more than one (he appears in all of&nbsp;them).</p>
<p>Being truly episodic lends Mushi-shi an air of atemporality. Although the order of episodes is clearly not arbitrary <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>, it is equally clear that it could be. Each episode contains a self-contained story, and they don&#8217;t reference each other at all. There is no shared context. Even the description of the mushi &#8212; the only extranormal aspect of the show &#8212; as life-forms that exist in a separate mode from the usual flora and fauna, is repeated almost every&nbsp;episode.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <em>Mushi-shi</em> manages a cohesive (and quite compelling) storyline. Ginko is a traveling &quot;mushi master&quot;, who thanks to some strange encounters with mushi as a youth, now attracts them. If he stays in one place, the mushi bring trouble to people around him. So he wanders from village to village, using his expertise to solve mushi-related problems, and conducting research on the mushi at the same time.
Counter-intuitively, an episodic storyline induces a strong sensation of permanence. Although the particular circumstances of Ginko&#8217;s life vary from day to day, his general circumstances never change &#8212; such a change would introduce context that would disrupt the atemporal episodicity. In this way, the show lacks almost everything that traditionally makes a story. It doesn&#8217;t bother with suspense or closure, or progression, or climax, except in bite-size segments. As a result, it is extremely&nbsp;calming.</p>
<p>The powerful peace of <em>Mushi-shi</em> lies not only in the show&#8217;s episodicity but also in the strength of the protagonist and the expanse of the setting. Ginko&#8217;s strength is his detachment and his rare and valuable knowledge. The setting&#8217;s expansiveness is a vast natural terrain pockmarked with small villages. It&#8217;s the kind of world where consequences are mitigated, and Ginko is the kind of protagonist who can do no wrong: he is protected by some of the strongest, least explained, and yet least grating &quot;plot armor&quot; I&#8217;ve ever seen. The combination of these factors with the show&#8217;s anti-story construction produces an experience that is almost spiritual in its preternatural, Zen-like routine. The result is, on inspection, completely debased from our uncertain reality, and yet exemplifies the equanimity and natural transience of the enlightened. Like much of the best fiction, <em>Mushi-shi</em> does not reflect reality, but uses storytelling to evoke emotion. However, instead of hope, love, despair or regret, that emotion is simple&nbsp;tranquility.</p>
