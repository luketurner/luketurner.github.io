		<p>I could say with pride that &quot;I don&#8217;t watch <span class="caps">TV</span>&quot; unlike all those other lazy loungers,
and in fact I have the opportunity to do so every two weeks when Charter calls me about &quot;bundle deals&quot;,
but the truth of the matter is I have my own flavors of &quot;hypnotainment&quot;: I watch
anime, devour Youtube videos (damn you Etho, stop talking about snacks), browse
Reddit, etc. So for a week I haven&#8217;t done any of those things and my life almost
fell apart. Just kidding. But it was hard: if I had given myself a longer time
than a week, I know I would have failed, perhaps as I sat home utterly bored on Sunday,
having checked out a book from the library and then found that it wasn&#8217;t very good,
or as I came home from work with no plans for the evening and no back-pocket strategy
to unwind, or when my DotA 2 friends invite me to play and I want nothing more than
to accept the invitation but I&nbsp;mustn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>To be more specific I followed an exact set of&nbsp;rules:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>First&nbsp;Dogma</dt>
<dd>No video games. Physical games are still&nbsp;allowed.</dd>
<dt>Second&nbsp;Dogma</dt>
<dd>No video entertainment - youtube or anime or&nbsp;movies.</dd>
<dt>Third&nbsp;Dogma</dt>
<dd>No reddit, or other Internet&nbsp;timewasting.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It&#8217;s not about what&#8217;s being rejected. I thought there was a chance that not having
easy recourse to reddit and Youtube would inspire me to be more productive, but I
suspected it wouldn&#8217;t, and it didn&#8217;t. To me it&#8217;s more about the taste of discipline
that comes from giving yourself an arbitrary rule and sticking to it. It&#8217;s about
practising the skill of self-control, like when your nose itches but you don&#8217;t
scratch it, just <em>because</em>.</p>
<p>Immediate reason is contrary to the concept of self-discipline. If you have a
good reason to do something, the presence of that reason mitigates the discipline
required. So I was never too concerned with the reason for taking a week off video
games, movies, anime, Youtube, and all social media and <span class="caps">BBS</span>-style websites. I was
curious to know if I could, and to see what I would do in all that spare time, and
so I just did it. (What did I do in my spare time? Read. In one week, I finished
three&nbsp;books.)</p>
<p>I actually kind of enjoyed the experience, although I wouldn&#8217;t say I found it
pleasant. Indeed; so used to having these fun, relaxing, time consuming activities
available, I suddenly found myself faced with the terror of unremitting boredom.
Risking melodrama, I can say I hated it. Yet, at the same time, there was a kind
of pleasure involved, like the masochistic pleasure that creeps through the pain
of a hard tissue massage. Is this what people mean by&nbsp;&quot;discipline&quot;?</p>
