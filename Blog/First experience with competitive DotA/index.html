	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The past Saturday was my first experience playing competitive DotA. I&#8217;ve DotA-ed for a long time but finally me and a few friends got a team together and headed out into <span class="caps">MLG</span> Open&nbsp;tournament-land.</p>
<p>At this point, our play is sloppy. Although we might be good individual players, our team dynamic is raw; all of us cut our teeth on Dota pubs, and there are a lot of bad habits to unlearn. We expected to be eliminated very quickly &#8212; perhaps even in the first game. However, the cost was only a $7.50 buy-in and a Saturday afternoon, and the benefit? An excellent learning&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>The day started off on the wrong foot when one of our players didn&#8217;t show up. Despite paying the buy-in and confirming the day before, he had some kind of as-yet-unexplained absence (I attribute it to girlfriend aggro &#8212; that Saturday was their anniversary). With one player short, we (may have) reverted to the extremely sketchy strategy of performing a last-minute substitution by having one of our friends change their Steam name to match the missing player&#8217;s. Thus we were able to&nbsp;participate.</p>
<p>This missing player, by the way, was probably the best player on our team and the only one of us who had any competitive DotA experience. He was our most versatile, experienced player. Our replacement for him, on the other hand, can&#8217;t solo, can&#8217;t carry, and had no experience playing in non-pub&nbsp;games.</p>
<p>So we already had an unexpected deficit of skill even before the tournament started. The bracket was up at 4:05 <span class="caps">PM</span> <span class="caps">EST</span>. At 4:02 <span class="caps">PM</span> <span class="caps">EST</span>, our team captain&#8217;s Internet went down. I made the game for the match anyway (as the higher seed, it was our responsibility to create the lobby). At about 4:10 our team captain was back. At this point we were just happy to have 5 people in the lobby before the forfeit&nbsp;limit.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the other team started joining. After the first opponent joined, our substitute (who was using DotaBuff for intel), piped up: &#8220;Wow&#8230; this guy is really good.&#8221; We all said, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s what we expected&#8230;&#8221; but he replied, &#8220;No, he&#8217;s <em>really</em> good.&#8221; Okay. Each additional player joining their team elicited a comment from the understudy: &#8220;Dude, these guys are, like,&nbsp;pro!&#8221;</p>
<p>We had entered expecting a challenge. The implicit assumption I carried at the time was that Understudy didn&#8217;t realize that this was a &#8220;real tournament&#8221; with a $500 prize. So he said, &#8220;these dudes are pro&#8221; and I thought, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s the&nbsp;point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Merlini joined the game. At this point I began to realize that Understudy was not fucking around. These guys were <strong>really</strong> good. When, always a skeptic, I checked his account and confirmed to the team that it was the real one &#8212; the legend himself &#8212; our Mumble channel went silent. This was the very moment that any remaining expectation of victory was hopelessly extinguished. Our candle, already sputtering, winked out&nbsp;completely.</p>
<p>The rest of the story barely needs to be told. During hero picks, one of us idly addressed our mid solo, a quiet guy specializing in <span class="caps">TA</span> and Puck: &#8220;You know&#8230; you will probably be laning against Merlini.&#8221; I nervously laughed. Our mid solo mumbled,&nbsp;&#8220;fuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>During hero picks, Team Captain tried to keep it together until the very last pick, when he seemed to give up. He picked himself Stealth Assassin and went top. We tried to tell ourselves that we should do our best, but we were deeply intimidated and also very distracted. I was extremely pleased to play against a figure I idolized. I remember watching Youtube videos of Merlini&#8217;s Zeus plays in DotA 1, and saying he was the best player in the world. The idea that he was on the other team seemed almost&nbsp;obscene. </p>
<p>As it turns out, Merlini played safe-lane solo Anti-Mage. Understudy offlaned against him with Clockwerk. To hear Understudy describe it, &#8220;this asshole was denying <em>everything!</em>&#8221; Merlini&#8217;s team picked a push comp with Chen, Furion, QoP, someone I forget, and Merlini. He got battlefury in under nine minutes, Chen and Furion pushed everything, and by about 15 minutes they were at the cliff going for mid rax. Our captain <span class="caps">GG</span>&#8217;d before they could climb the&nbsp;hill.</p>
<p>At the time I thought this was in poor form. It was an early surrender; it was an admission that there was no point in even trying. Looking back, though, I&#8217;m sure they were pleased to see our early <span class="caps">GG</span> &#8212; obviously they went a push strat with the intent of blowing us up fast and moving on. I&#8217;ve realized that our captain&#8217;s <span class="caps">GG</span> was not a premature capitulation but a graceful, almost apologetic acknowledgement that we had no business even trying to pretend we could compete. At the same time it may have conveyed some of our frustration; we felt like our &#8220;tournament experience&#8221; was replaced by a humiliating stomp. By the time of our <span class="caps">GG</span>, there were over 2,400 people watching our game with a short delay on Merlini&#8217;s livestream. They didn&#8217;t seem phased by our complete lack of&nbsp;resistance.</p>
<p>And that was my first experience playing competitive&nbsp;DotA.</p>
<p>Merlini&#8217;s team won the tournament handily. Their team name was <a href="http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/pc/dota-2/team/psst3">psst3</a>. I can only imagine the name was intended to be, &#8220;Psst, listen, this is a secret, but our team is really good, we will smash you&#8221;, but that exceeded the length limit for team names. In the next <span class="caps">MLG</span> tournament, the <a href="http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/pc/dota-2/tournament/mlg-columbus-dota-2-qualifier">Columbus DotA 2 Qualifier</a>, there&#8217;s a team named <a href="http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/pc/dota-2/team/psst4">psst4</a>. It&#8217;s missing a lot of players, though. I wonder who&#8217;s on&nbsp;it?</p>
<p><span class="caps">P.S.</span> Me and my team are still serious about getting better and playing in more tournaments (as serious as people with full-time jobs acan be about a video game). I don&#8217;t feel any ill-will towards our stompers. Although the game didn&#8217;t reveal useful information about the skill of the average DotA competitor, it left us with a fascinating, humiliating, informative, and arrested&nbsp;replay.</p>
