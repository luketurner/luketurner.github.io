<p>A weakly godlike intelligence is not a supernatural agency but the product of a highly advanced society that learned how to create souls [late twentieth century: <em>software</em>] and translate human bodies into souls and vice versa. [Core concepts: Human beings all have souls. Souls are software objects. Software is not&nbsp;immortal.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a sentient city on Saturn welcomes resimulated historical humans, whose state vectors are beamed from Earth by the Vile Outsiders in order to save them before Earth is converted to computational matter &#8212; or are the Vile Outsiders deliberately influencing the human&#8217;s elections by injecting masses of highly conservative voters, thereby minimizing the potential for humankind to use Saturn&#8217;s inertial energy to leave the solar system? After all, Saturn&#8217;s energy output is a highly valuable commodity in Economics 2.0, and the humans, too backwards to even comprehend the new order, are worthless in&nbsp;comparison.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Accelerando</em> is the work of a mad scientist: hectic, visionary, unique, and&nbsp;flawed&#8230;</p>
<p>Charles Stross is an idea machine, and <em>Accelerando</em> is his imagination&nbsp;overflowing&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Accelerando</em> is the ultimate transhumanist fiction: take a computational theory of mind, add some Moore&#8217;s Law and a heaping serving of self-improving advanced general <span class="caps">AI</span>, and you&#8217;ve got a singularity&nbsp;cooking&#8230;</p>
<p>Persistently following a human narrative in the face of incomprehensible technology and posthuman <span class="caps">AI</span>, Charles Stross gives the reader hope that mankind can thrive in the face of transcendent machinery and then gleefully pulls the rug from beneath&nbsp;them&#8230;</p>
<p>Damn! I need an opening sentence! Something that relates the unrelatable&#8230; explains the unexplainable&#8230; <a href="http://itsthisforthat.com/">aha</a>!</p>
<p>So basically, Charles Stross&#8217;s <em>Accelerando</em> is like <em>Neuromancer</em> for the 21st century. Expanding on concepts from transhumanist thinkers with his own strangely plausible ideas, Stross illustrates a transhumanist future in all its glorious, terrifying detail. Tucked between the engaging-but-not-thrilling narrative and the lengthy, creative, and multitudinous descriptions of an intra-singularity world, Stross asks the question: what happens when humanity obsoletes&nbsp;itself?</p>
<p>This is a book written by a nerd for nerds. Unless you&#8217;re a computer scientist with an extensive vocabulary, expect to be confounded: keep Wikipedia handy. Don&#8217;t give in to criticism: sure, Stross misuses some terminology, and yeah, maybe some of his ideas are not really feasible (some are straight-up nonsensical), but this is a book that goes for quantity over quality. Like Manfred Macx, one of Stross&#8217; protagonists, an entrepreneur who files five patents before breakfast, Stross spits out idea after crazy idea. Try to leave pedanticism behind, and you&#8217;ll enjoy the&nbsp;ride.</p>
