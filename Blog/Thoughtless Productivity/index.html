		<p>It seems that productivity has become a critical metric. Productivity is so emphasized, procrastination has become the enemy. In other words, we&#8217;ve become overridingly concerned about efficiency of our use of&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Akrasia">Akrasia</a> is a Greek word for the subtle cognitive muddle which leads to one doing something they don&#8217;t want to do. When an <span class="caps">AA</span> member falls off the wagon, that&#8217;s akrasia. More relatably, when you watch <span class="caps">TV</span> instead of reading in the evening, or hit Snooze on the alarm in the morning instead of getting up and practicing headstands, that&#8217;s&nbsp;akrasia.</p>
<p>The profligate expansion of <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1sm/akrasia_tactics_review/">anti-akrasia tools</a> illustrates the extent of contemporary interest in maintaining a procrastination-free lifestyle. Why is procrastination such a concern? I think it stems in part from the modern era&#8217;s emphasis on efficiency and productivity as key metrics, but it&#8217;s become such a serious problem because we find ourselves in positions of unparalleled leisure. Instead of basically having to work all the time, many of us find more and more time is available to be devoted to our own interests&#8230; and we&#8217;re ashamed to discover that, given the freedom to choose, we tend to pick television and video games over more engaging or &#8220;beneficial&#8221;&nbsp;pursuits.</p>
<p>Most productivity techniques emphasize task-completion as the success measure. For instance, &#8220;read <span class="caps">CS</span> papers for an hour a night,&#8221; &#8220;hit the gym three times a week,&#8221; or &#8220;implement correctness testing in <a href="https://github.com/luketurner/cluster.js">cluster.js</a>&#8220;. Although these are surely admirable goals, I am rather more interested in techniques that target the central habituation that induces akrasia. Completing the goals themselves is not as important as fixing the goal-seeking&nbsp;apparatus.</p>
<p>If you have to <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">threaten yourself</a> to get anything done, I suspect you are merely inducing reliance on external mechanisms without resolving the internal dysfunction. What happens when you suddenly need to motivate yourself in a way that&#8217;s not compatible with your tools? Why is it so easy to do some things, but so hard to do others? Do we really want to force ourselves to suffer and struggle, by making the alternative <em>even worse</em>?</p>
<p>A relevant consideration: we are starting to think that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">our willpower store is limited</a>. However, most anti-akrasia tools seem to require use of willpower; they fail to adjust the desired activity such that it&#8217;s no longer undesirable, instead attempting to force us to do it anyway. Isn&#8217;t it better to orient ourselves such that these activities don&#8217;t require such an expenditure of our willpower? After all, true willpower, which underpins discipline, should be saved for when it&#8217;s needed and not frittered away left and&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>Instead of struggling with ourselves to do what we know we ought to do, we want the activity to flow naturally. We don&#8217;t want to struggle. We want to be at peace, thoughtlessly productive, to move through &#8220;tasks&#8221; (better thought of as <em>states</em>) as naturally as water navigates the&nbsp;riverbed.</p>
<p>I have been ruminating on two tools which I am putting into effect in an attempt to counter akrasia and to correct any procrastinatory cognitive&nbsp;dysfunction.</p>
<p>You should see posts on these topics in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p><strong>First: Identity&nbsp;modification</strong></p>
<p>Change your perception of&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<p>The first such technique is making the activity &#8220;obvious&#8221; by adjusting your self-image. I like to call this process &#8220;Identity Modification,&#8221; but some people also call it &#8220;Affirmation.&#8221; Some people are naturally productive in different ways. Can we use statements of belief to modify our perception of ourselves in such a way that we are able to perform tasks naturally? Can I maintain a well-managed home life by inserting &#8220;I am on top of my responsibilities&#8221; and &#8220;I maintain a clean environment&#8221; into my&nbsp;self-image?</p>
<p><strong>Second:&nbsp;Monoidealism</strong></p>
<p>Change your perception of the&nbsp;activity.</p>
<p>Monoidealism means, literally, having only one thought. In this case we mean adjusting our perception of a task to allow no alternatives. Monoidealism is widely used as a hypnotic tool. The trick, of course, is quieting your metamind to such an extent that you can truly focus on a single task. Once the focus is created, &#8220;doing the task&#8221; becomes an&nbsp;afterthought.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a post about monoidealism <a href="http://luketurner.org/blog/2013/09/16/monoidealism/">here</a>.</p>
