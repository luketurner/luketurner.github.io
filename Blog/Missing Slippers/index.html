		<p>It&#8217;s the middle of autumn. It seems like the temperature is dropping a few degrees
every day. Your apartment has hardwood floors that feel like ice on bare feet, and your
circulation isn&#8217;t very good down in your fingers and toes, so you&#8217;ve started wearing
slippers at home. Every day you get home from work, take off your shoes, and
slide on your&nbsp;slippers.</p>
<p>The floor&#8217;s worst in the mornings, so every night you lock your apartment door,
turn off the light, and walk over to bed. You take off your slippers, leaving them
neatly side-by-side, so you can sit up in the morning and slip them on, never
having to touch the floor with bare&nbsp;feet.</p>
<p>One day, you follow the same routine: lock the door, lights off, slippers by the
bed. You snuggle into your comforter and fall into a deep, uninterrupted sleep.
In the morning, your alarm wakes you up as usual. The air outside your blankets
feels like it could freeze you solid. As you groggily reach over to
turn off the alarm, you get the sense that something is wrong. Suddenly you freeze,
goosebumps creeping up your spine. Your hand is hovering over the still-beeping
alarm, but your attention is elsewhere: your slippers aren&#8217;t by your bed where
you left them. In fact, as you look around, you don&#8217;t see them anywhere in the room.
Didn&#8217;t you leave them there, side-by-side, like you always&nbsp;do?</p>
<p>Slowly, almost unwillingly, you notice something else: your apartment door&#8217;s
deadbolt lever, that you conscientiously flip to the right every night, is turned
left: the door is&nbsp;unlocked.</p>
