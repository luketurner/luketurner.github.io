		<p>Have you ever started a trip early in the morning? Why is it that you can wake up at 5:00, roll out of bed, shower and be ready to go by 5:30, without struggling with motivation? It&#8217;s not a matter of exertion; it&#8217;s a matter of focus. As soon as you wake up, your mind is absorbed by your trip. Waking up instantly, not wasting time in the shower, moving swiftly through your routine &#8212; these things are done naturally. This is an example of&nbsp;monoidealism.</p>
<p>For a monoidealist, there&#8217;s no such thing as an option: there simply is a task &#8212; or what I call a <em>state</em>. Being fully committed to a single state, a single idea: that&#8217;s monoidealism. Neither looking forward to the end of the activity, nor occupying your mind with anything irrelevant,  you are focused and&nbsp;singleminded.</p>
<p>Now, there is already a quantity of material about monoidealism out there (<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/fh/willpower_hax_487_execute_by_default/c2k">for example</a>). The same technique is sometimes called <em>Just Do It</em>, and it bears a close resemblance to &#8220;the flow.&#8221; I don&#8217;t want to go into great detail about exactly what it is. Instead, I want to talk about my personal experience with&nbsp;monoidealism.</p>
<p><strong>Monoidealism resists&nbsp;cultivation</strong></p>
<p>At times, monoidealism is naturally acquired: when one gets absorbed in a book or a movie, when an interesting problem engages one&#8217;s attention, or when some important thing is in the works (like a job interview, a critical meeting, a deadline, or a DotA tournament). However, it&#8217;s a difficult state to generate deliberately. In this way it&#8217;s similar to the state of mental calm cultivated by meditation &#8212; the very attempt to enter the state brings to mind alternatives that damage its purity. The more compelling the alternatives, the more difficult it is to focus on the task at&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>The best way I&#8217;ve found to cultivate monoidealism is with careful visualization before the task, and with deliberate engagement during it. I imagine mindfulness would be a beneficial trait for cultivating monoidealism; living &#8220;in the moment&#8221; precludes alternatives. Indeed, monoidealism is a side-effect of close, caring engagement with a&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p><strong> Misplaced monoidealism can be&nbsp;harmful </strong></p>
<p>The past week has found me obsessed with a Feed the Beast Minecraft server. It&#8217;s practically all I could think about. Unfortunately this kind of monoidealism damaged my responsibilities: I could hardly go to sleep for excited planning of my base, it was difficult to engage myself at work without watching the clock for the moment I could rush home, and the gym was out of the question: that&#8217;s an extra hour I&#8217;d have to wait before I could&nbsp;play!</p>
<p>Luckily, my continuous obsession burnt itself out very quickly. My mind rushed so far ahead in planning all my future building that for the few hours I could actually play, I felt like I was just playing &#8220;catch-up,&#8221; and not having much&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>Anyway, these little obsessive tangents can be fun for a while, but they are dangerous. I tend to have this problem with very exciting new things: they take over my mind like a virus. The new activity is so compelling that it&#8217;s almost impossible for me to get focused on anything else. Is there a solution? Only one that I&#8217;ve discovered: deconstruct your excitement to worthlessness (this is easy to do since pretty much everything is pointless at the&nbsp;roots). </p>
