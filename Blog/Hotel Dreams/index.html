		<p>I was haunted again this week by the specter of the weird hotel&nbsp;dream.</p>
<p>Although we are not yet sure why people dream, it has been shown (in studies that involve waking people up at odd hours and asking them about their dreams) that people generally experience two different varieties of dream: during deep sleep, usually only occurring for a period around 1-3 <span class="caps">AM</span>, we experience dreams of reenactment. Reenactment dreams are thought to be a way of dealing with recent experiences; they are suspected to be responsible for the phenomenon of improving ability to perform a task after sleep (&quot;sleeping on it&quot;). We don&#8217;t usually remember these dreams since we are rarely awoken during the deep sleep period. On the other hand, the second type of dream occurs during <span class="caps">REM</span> sleep. <span class="caps">REM</span> sleep dreams are usually quite fantastic, not historical. They are thought to be a mechanism for future planning &#8212; sort of like &quot;what would I do if&#8230;&quot; visualizations. Since <span class="caps">REM</span> sleep occurs more frequently around the time we usually wake in the morning, these dreams are more often&nbsp;remembered.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that &quot;hotel dreams&quot; are dramatic <span class="caps">REM</span>-sleep dreams that are triggered during travel when the brain is exposed to sudden novelty. Because we suddenly are thrust into an experience different from our daily routine, our dream &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios become more pronounced and more unusual. In other words, the novel experience of travel causes the brain to prep for even more novel experiences, which we experience as weird-as-shit <span class="caps">REM</span>&nbsp;dreams.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this hypothesis doesn&#8217;t dampen the surreality of waking up crying at 5:00 <span class="caps">AM</span> in a hotel bed. Although I can no longer recall the contents of the dream, I can still recall the poignant sense of loss I felt on that early Tuesday&nbsp;morning.</p>
