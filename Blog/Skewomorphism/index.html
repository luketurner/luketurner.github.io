		<p>I asserted for many years that it&#8217;s not hard to keep a mental barrier between &#8220;reality&#8221; and &#8220;fantasy.&#8221; I was&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to renege on my belief that people who play Grand Theft Auto don&#8217;t become inclined to commit grand theft auto, but rather to introduce some depth to the dialogue that belies any bold-face metaphors like &#8220;mental&nbsp;barrier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyday decision-making, especially in casual conversation, is primarily driven by mimetic tools and experiential data, broadly assessed in an instant by heuristic thought processes which produce a result that is rarely ideal and only occasionally appropriate. Post-hoc deliberation often produces a better result: we can usually come up with a good response to almost any situation, sometimes even as early as a few minutes after the scenario flits through our experience. Of course, this capacity is generally worthless, except for embellishing stories and posting on&nbsp;Reddit.</p>
<p>So, suppose you (like me) spend your leisure time engaged in the fantastic: movies, anime, video games, novels, and reading on the Internet. Well, what kind of corpora are you collating in your network of neural circuitry? What collaborated but uncorroborated data will be available to the intuitive heuristic that fires to collect a response to an idle comment? Your experience is subtly undermined by&nbsp;fiction.</p>
<p>In conversation, your partner throws out an unexpected query: &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you getting huge yet?&#8221; For you, this is a challenge to properly field, because it&#8217;s true that you&#8217;ve been trying to eat healthier and be fitter, but you haven&#8217;t been to the gym in months. You find your lack of motivation embarrassing, even though it&#8217;s totally normal. What&#8217;re you to do? If your first thought was &#8220;what would X say,&#8221; then you are resorting to modeling your behavior off a role model of some kind, and you are already knee-deep in shit. If your &#8220;X&#8221; is fictional, you&#8217;re not knee deep &#8212; you&#8217;re drowning. I&#8217;m&nbsp;drowning.</p>
<p>Sorry, it&#8217;s not like I have a solution or anything. In fact, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a handy solution, any more than there is to the problem of physical acuity facing an adult who as a child never fought anybody or fostered athleticism and rarely even challenged himself on the playground. Some things are easily, naturally accomplished as children yet challenge adults because we understand expectations and&nbsp;inhibitions.</p>
<p>I guess the best bet is to flip fiction the bird and get some experiences of your own, but it&#8217;s obviously easier said than done. As an adult I&#8217;m supposed to behave, and I have to live with these people so I don&#8217;t want to just go off the fucking wall as a form of data aggregation. I think that&#8217;s one of the advantages of&nbsp;traveling.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s another side to the story: one becomes adept at navigating cyberspace. I sometimes feel like I belong on the other side of the keyboard, inside the monitor, in the expanse of the network. It&#8217;s where I feel comfortable; free to be myself, agile, and experienced. But that doesn&#8217;t help me in the real world. The experience doesn&#8217;t correspond. Where does that put someone who has 20,000 hours of computer use but only a few thousand of generalizable human&nbsp;interaction?</p>
<p>This is the phenomenon of skewomorphism: when a model of reality includes elements derived from the&nbsp;non-real.</p>
