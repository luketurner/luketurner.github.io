<p>I could say with pride that "I don’t watch <span class="caps">TV</span>" unlike all those other lazy loungers,
but the truth of the matter is I have my own flavor of "hypnotainment" when I watch
anime, devour Youtube videos (damn you Etho, stop talking about snacks), browse
Reddit, etc. So for a week I haven’t done any of those things and my life almost
fell apart. Just kidding. But it was hard: if I had given myself a longer time
than a week, I know I would have failed, perhaps as I sat home utterly bored on Sunday,
having checked out a book from the library and then found that it wasn’t very good,
or as I came home from work with no plans for the evening and no back-pocket strategy
to unwind, or when my DotA 2 friends invite me to play and I want nothing more than
to accept the invitation but I mustn’t.</p>
<p>It’s not about what’s being rejected. I thought there was a chance that not having
easy recourse to Reddit and Youtube would inspire me to be more productive, but I
suspected it wouldn’t, and it didn’t. To me it’s more about the taste of discipline
that comes from giving yourself an arbitrary rule and sticking to it. It’s about
practising the skill of self-control, like when your nose itches but you don’t
scratch it, just <em>because</em>.</p>
<p>Immediate reason is contrary to the concept of self-discipline. If you have a
good reason to do something, the presence of that reason mitigates the discipline
required. So I was never too concerned with the reason for taking a week off video
games, movies, anime, Youtube, and all social media and <span class="caps">BBS</span>-style websites. I was
curious to know if I could, and to see what I would do in all that spare time, and
so I just did it. (What did I do in my spare time? Read. In one week, I finished
three books.)</p>
<p>I actually kind of enjoyed the experience, although I wouldn’t say I found it
pleasant. Indeed; so used to having these fun, relaxing, time consuming activities
available, I suddenly found myself faced with the terror of unremitting boredom.
Risking melodrama, I can say I hated it. Yet, at the same time, there was a kind
of pleasure involved, like the masochistic pleasure that creeps through the pain
of a hard tissue massage.</p>
<p>I think next week I’ll do it again, with a different rule.</p>
